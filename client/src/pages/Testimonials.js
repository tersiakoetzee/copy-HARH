								Was at HARH in 2012 for 9 months and the experience was life
								changing where I met Jesus and got saved. The program was
								disciplined and it has prepared us for some of life&apos;’s
								challenges we might face. I&apos;’m currently working as a field
								agent for an asset management company and have been married for
								4 years.

							<h2>Living Life to the Fullest</h2>
							<p className="testimonial-copy">
								I was on drugs for 6 years, addicted to crystal meth and
								mandrax. I went to Hope Again in March 2009, and finished my
								program in September 2009, and graduated. I have been clean for
								14 years— praise God! I am currently employed as an accounts
								clerk. God has been amazing and blessed me with a better
								position where I will move to soon. God has been amazing and
								faithful, I count my blessings 1 by 1 and am forever grateful
								for what the Lord has done in my life. I have my own car, my own
								house, which God has blessed me with after losing everything in
								my life. 2021 was a drastic change after I lost my mom to Covid.
								I have struggled a lot but God has been faithful and carried me
								through. I have a son aged 11, who is my biggest supporter. We
								are living life to the fullest and thank God every day for
								carrying us through!{" "}
